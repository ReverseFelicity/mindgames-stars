# Mind games challenge starter kit

Welcome to the Mind Games Challenge Starter Kit! This guide will help you set up your environment and get started with the competition.

For more information about the competition, please visit our [official website](https://www.mindgamesarena.com/).

## Register your team

Complete your team registration via our official registration form. Upon registration, you will receive two automated emails:

- Confirmation Email: Contains registration details and an editable link for updates
- Security Credentials Email: Contains your unique team verification codes for agent deployment. You will use the `team_hash` as your unique token to participate in the competition. It is in this format: `MG25-XXXXXXXXXX`. This hash is unique to your team and should be kept confidential.

## Install necessary packages

```shell
pip install textarena
```

## Offline testing

To test your agent offline, you can refer to the `offline_play.py` script. This script allows you to run games locally without needing to connect to the online arena. You can use it to simulate matches and evaluate your agent's performance. You can also play with your agent and familiarize yourself with the game mechanics and interface.

If you want to train your agent locally, you can also collect game data from offline play. The `offline_play.py` script can be modified to save game states and actions, which can then be used to train your agent using supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning techniques.

## Online competition

To participate in the online competition, you can refer to the `online_play.py` script. This script is designed to connect your agent to the online arena, match it against other agents, compete in real-time, and update the results in our online leaderboard.

When you run `ta.make_mgc_online`, you will join the matching pool for the specified games. If another agent is available, a match will be created, and your agent will compete against it. To make the matching easier for this competition, we will periodically hold matches during the competition period. 

In `ta.make_mgc_online` function, you have to provide `env_id`, your `model_name`, `model_description`, `team_hash`, and your agent instance. The `env_id` is a list of game environments you want to participate in, such as `["ConnectFour-v0-train", "DontSayIt-v0-train"]`. The unique `model_name` and `model_description` are used to identify your agent in the online arena and leaderboard. The `team_hash` is your unique team verification code.

All other interfaces remain the same as in the offline play.

## Agent development

We provide a basic agent template in the `agent.py` file. You can extend this template to create your own agent.

For example, `HumanAgent` allows you to play the game manually, while `LLMAgent` is designed to use a large language model (LLM) to make decisions based on the game state. 

When you are developing your agent, you only need to inherit from the `Agent` class and implement the `__call__` method in your agent class. The function signature is `__call__(self, observation: str) -> str:`, where `observation` is a string representation of the current game state, and the method should return a string representing the action your agent wants to take.

In our `LLMAgent` example, we use huggingface's `transformers` library to load a pre-trained model and tokenizer. When the agent is called, it uses the huggingface pipeline to generate a response based on the observation. You can customize this `__call__` method to implement your own agent workflow, and you can also train your agent for specific games or strategies.
