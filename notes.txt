Current observations: 
[GAME] You are playing Codenames, a 2v2 word deduction game. Each team (Red and Blue) has a Spymaster and an Operative.
Rules:
1. The Spymaster gives a one-word clue + number (e.g., '[wind 2]') based on the team's secret words (the clue may not contain any of the words on the board).
2. The Operative guesses up to N+1 words (e.g., '[breeze]') based on the clue. They can also '[pass]'.
3. Avoid guessing opponent words, neutral words (N), or the Assassin (A), which causes instant loss.
4. First team to guess all their words wins.

You are Player 0, the Spymaster for Red team. Give a one-word clue and number.
